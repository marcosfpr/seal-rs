# Concurrency is employed to avoid multiple identical workflows from running concurrently. When a new event is triggered
# while this workflow is active, the new workflow will be executed, and the previous one will be terminated. It's
# important to note that the group is the current ref, typically the current branch, and as a result, different branches
# won't affect each other.
